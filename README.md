- 👋 Hi you, I’m Kaya Karakaya, github@kaya979.
- 👀 Enthusiast about cloud, especially AWS.
- 🌱 I am steadily advancing in deploying resources in AWS through Salt and Terraform on VSCode. 
- 🌱 Focus is on Python, AWS, Terraform.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on aws-terraform projects.
- 📫 How to reach me? ==> kaya.md@gmail.com
-    When things get tough, I never ever give up. Steadily, gradually my understanding increases. Ups and downs will come and go. My perseverance is all that is needed. I discipline myself to show up on time and keep myself trajected in the 24 hours I have in a day. Like a rock in a storm I am, I remind constantly, that all things and thoughts will pass. Cloud is the Future!
